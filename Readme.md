# Setting Up Environment Variables for API Keys

To run this project, you need to set up environment variables for the API keys. Follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholder values with your actual API keys:

```
OPENAPI=your_openweathermap_api_key
GOOGLEAPI=your_google_api_key
```

3. Save the `.env` file.

Your environment variables are now set up and will be used by the application to access the necessary API keys.
